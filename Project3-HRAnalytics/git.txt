Welcome to my HR Analytics Dashboard project, created during my internship at MeriSKILL. This project focuses on enhancing and visualizing HR data for insightful analytics.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on the HR Analytics Dashboard, which involved various tasks to improve the dataset's quality and the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI and Excel.

## Tasks Performed

Here's an outline of the tasks performed during the project:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed redundant columns.
  - Renamed columns for clarity.
  - Handled duplicates and cleaned individual columns.
  - Eliminated NaN values to ensure data quality.

- **Data Transformation**:
  - Applied various data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **Dashboard Creation**:
  - Leveraged Power BI and Excel to create a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard.

## Dashboard Overview

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool providing valuable insights into the workforce, including key metrics such as:

- Total number of employee attritions.
- Attrition rate.
- Average age.
- Average salary.
- Average years of service.

The dashboard delves deeper into attrition data by categorizing it based on factors such as education level, age groups, gender distribution, and more.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

Here are some key insights derived from the dashboard:

- Employees with salaries less than $5,000 exhibit the highest attrition rate.
- The age group between 15 and 26 years shows a higher attrition rate compared to others.
- A satisfaction level by job role graph helps identify departments with dissatisfied employees.
- An attrition by job role graph correlates satisfaction levels with attrition rates.
- A line graph displays attrition by years of service, indicating that most departing employees have worked for only one year.

The dashboard also allows for in-depth analysis by departments, including Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome feedback and contributions to this project. If you have any suggestions, questions, or ideas for improvement, please feel free to create a GitHub issue or reach out directly.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to MeriSKILL for providing me with this valuable opportunity to work on this project.

## Conclusion

The data suggests that employees who are relatively new to the job, particularly those at entry levels, tend to leave the company most frequently, often within the first year.

Thank you for exploring my HR Analytics Dashboard project. I hope you find it informative and insightful.
